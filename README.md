# EECS6891 System Optimization with AI/ML
Operating systems, storage systems, networks and distributed systems include many tunable parameters that can affect overall performance. System programmers and providers of these services and distributions are typically conservative with default settings in order to provide a balanced performance for a vast variety of workloads and applications and at the same time they are hesitant to change default system settings that might introduce instability.
Yet, in order to achieve optimal workload performance, the underlying systems are or have to then routinely be tuned on site through those countless available system knobs. At the same time application developers and deployers often donâ€™t have the time or the skills to determine the suitable combination of system settings. Many techniques in operation today were historically developed with human intuition based on a few workloads; but such techniques cannot easily adapt to ever-changing workloads and system diversities. In addition, as we expand into cloud based virtualized environments the workloads are not known a priori which further makes tuning difficult.
